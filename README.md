1. Load the dataset
2. It is always a good practice to eye-ball raw data to get a feel of the data in
terms of number of records, structure of the file, number of attributes, Mention a few comments in this regard.
3. Using univariate & bivariate analysis to check the individual attributes for
their basic statistics such as central values, spread, tails, relationships
between variables etc. mention your observations 
4. Splitthedatasetintotrainingandtestsetintheratioof70:30
(Training:Test) 
5. Prepare the data for training - Scale the data if necessary, get rid of missing
values (if any) etc 
6. Trainatleast3standardclassificationalgorithms-LogisticRegression,
Naive Bayesâ€™, SVM, k-NN etc, and note down their accuracies on the test
data 
7. Train a meta-classifier and note the accuracy on test data 
8. TrainatleastonestandardEnsemblemodel-Randomforest,Bagging,
Boosting etc, and note the accuracy 
9. Compare all the models (minimum 5) and pick the best one among them
